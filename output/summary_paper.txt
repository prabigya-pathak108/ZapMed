the first incident happened when changing an emptyIV fluid bag for a full one led to spillage of some fluid onto the keyboard electric connection and 1 in the cardiology department, which was damagaed due to coffee on it. the first incidence was due to the use of needle to depressurize a medication bottle for continuous IV drip, and the third event was caused by disconnection of the IV set from the bottle during transfer of patient from operation room to intensive care unit. third, changing of human behavior; to do this, we announced the protocol in our anesthesia conference to make it known to each and every one. 0, which allows others to remix, tweak, and build upon the work, even for commercial purposes, as long as the author is credited and the new creations are licensed under identical terms. in 24 cases of deaths, the patientâ€™s death was considered to result from the anesthetic procedure: 4 deaths were related to airway management, 2 to ventilation management and 4 as a result of medication errors, 4 from infusion pump problems, and 3 after complications from regional blockades. The aim of this study is to evaluate our simplified approach to manage and prevent human error and consequently improve patient safety. we need to put these differences in mind, while managing human errors. we found a report of an incident of malfunction of the computer keyboard due to humidity condensation.Malfunction of machines has an economic impact on the hospital (about $ 20,000) in addition to the nonavailability of US machine for the cardiac patient after the incident till the end of case and for consequent cases until the fixation of this machine if fluid is harmful to us machine, it can be detrimental to our system at any time during continuous IV drip transfer from operation room this means that IV pulls are on each side of the patient bed, which makes the machine vulnerable to fluid spillage.
